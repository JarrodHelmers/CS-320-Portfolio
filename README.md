## Reflections

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by following a thorough process. This includes testing individual parts to make sure they work as expected, having peers review my code to catch any issues I might have missed, and using tools to identify security problems and code issues.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Gathering user needs involves getting requirements through methods such as interviews, surveys, and direct feedback. I then turn these needs into functional requirements and use cases. I prioritize features based on user impact and feasibility to make sure that the most important needs are dealt with first. Getting continuous feedback from users during the development process helps improve the program to better match their expectations.

### How do I approach designing software?
When I design software, I start by understanding the problem and what is needed. Then I draw diagrams to show the main parts of the system and how they work together. After that, I plan the details, like what parts the system will have and how they will work. I follow design rules like SOLID and DRY to make sure the software can be easily changed and can grow. I also think about any unusual situations and places where the software might be slow.
